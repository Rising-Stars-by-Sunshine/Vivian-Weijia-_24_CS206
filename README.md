## 🧐Professional Profile
- Intellectual Growth:
  In my computer science journey, I've come to understand that my greatest intellectual growth emerges from applying abstract technology concepts to tangible societal issues. Within this course, I intend to immerse myself in case studies where machine learning has tackled social and economic challenges. By grappling with the real-world implications, ethical dilemmas, and the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration, I aim to transform theoretical knowledge into impactful practices. I envision engaging in problem-based learning, interacting with industry experts, and partnering with peers from diverse academic backgrounds to deepen my understanding and application of machine learning.
  
- Professional Growth:
  My experience with GitHub, Colab, LaTeX, and various graph tools has laid down a solid technical foundation. To further my professional development in this course, I plan to embark on projects that demand the rigorous use of these tools, advancing from familiarity to mastery. I am also keen on contributing to open-source projects, pursuing internships, and facilitating workshops on these tools to refine my professional skills and prepare myself for the tech industry.
  
- Living a Purposeful Life:
  I aspire to be at the forefront of AI security, preventing security issues from obstructing the beneficial use of AI. I can almost visualize a future where I might be honored with recognitions like the Nobel or Turing Award, with a defining phrase to my name: “Pioneering safer AI for a secure future.” To realize this vision, I am committed to contributing to pioneering research in AI security, partnering with global security agencies, educating the public on AI risks, and developing accessible security resources. These endeavors will not only fulfill my personal aspirations but also serve to enhance the collective welfare of human civilization, aligning with a multi-objective perspective of progress and safety.
