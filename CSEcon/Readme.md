## Question one

When envisioning the convergence of computer science and economics, I aspire to follow in the footsteps of Nobel laureate Claudia Goldin and Turing Award recipients Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, each making profound contributions to their respective fields.
Claudia Goldin's groundbreaking research on gender differences in the labor market illuminates the intricate interplay of social structures, education, and individual career expectations (The Nobel Prize, 2023). Inspired by her work, I recognize the importance of adjusting my own career attitudes and preparing for the challenges influenced by gender dynamics.
Likewise, the pioneering work of Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie in asymmetric public-key cryptography revolutionized cybersecurity (Association for Computing Machinery, 2019). Their invention laid the foundation for secure communication in the digital age, an area of immense relevance and interest to me.
Considering the advancements made by these esteemed scholars, I am acutely aware of the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital labor market. The proliferation of career opportunities in this realm underscores the significance of adopting appropriate career expectations. Notably, while artificial intelligence (AI) was once merely capable of identifying cats on YouTube with limited accuracy (New York Times, 2023), it has now become a dominant force. However, the security implications of generative AI, encompassing images, text, and audio, remain prominent alongside its advancements.
My envisioned contribution lies in addressing the security challenges posed by generative AI, guided by the pioneering work of Hellman and Diffie. By leveraging their principles in asymmetric cryptography, I aim to fortify the security infrastructure of generative AI systems, ensuring their responsible and safe deployment in various domains.
In essence, by synthesizing insights from economics and computer science, I endeavor to advance human civilization by promoting gender equity in the labor market and bolstering the security of emerging technologies, thereby fostering a more inclusive and secure digital future.

## Question Two
The synergy between computer science and economics serves as a potent catalyst for driving innovation toward a brighter future. Professor Bing Luo's insight, "Only the problems from the industry are more concrete" (Luo, 2024), resonates deeply in this context. Drawing from the experiences shared by KONE company and Microsoft China Incubation Lab, it becomes evident that leveraging both disciplines can effectively spur innovation.
At the core of this synergy lie the challenges articulated by KONE company during their digital and AI transformation. These challenges encompass diverse economic concerns such as increasing labor costs, alongside technological imperatives like adapting to the digital ecosystem and competing in digital marketing. By addressing these challenges through a strategic fusion of digital operations, offerings, and foundational technologies, KONE aims not only to enhance efficiency and productivity but also to deliver superior customer experiences, thus driving business innovation.
Moreover, insights from the Microsoft China Incubation Lab underscore the importance of an economic perspective in designing innovative products. Understanding customer needs deeply, analyzing product functionality and context meticulously, and iterating based on user feedback are highlighted as pivotal steps in the process. This underscores the intertwined nature of economics and computer science in fostering successful innovation.
The amalgamation of insights from these industries underscores the indispensability of the synergy between computer science and economics in innovation endeavors. Whether in defining innovation goals or navigating the iterative design process, leveraging knowledge from both fields is imperative in tackling real-world business challenges in the era of big data.

## Question Three

The interplay between aspects of human nature, such as bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies like generative AI, is reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts. Researchers are employing bounded rationality as a benchmark to assess the human-likeness of AI agents, continually testing these agents through various rationality experiments. For instance, Kojima et al. (2022) propose zero-shot-CoT, which elicits chains of thought from large language models (LLMs) across different reasoning tasks, suggesting that AI agents possess their own thinking processes. Similarly, Fan et al. (2023) demonstrate in their study on game theory that GPT-4 exhibits remarkably human-like performance. However, while LLMs can emulate human thought processes to an extent, they often fall short of truly objective and independent decision-making, particularly when modifying preferences or refining beliefs.
In economic contexts, the rationality and irrationality of current LLMs become evident. Chen et al. (2023) assess the economic rationality of GPT models across various preferences, finding that while GPT often outperforms humans in rationality scores, it also tends to exhibit irrationality and sensitivity to language context. Moreover, Zhou et al. (2024) comprehensively analyze 19 leading LLMs' financial rationality, revealing that models of different sizes display varying degrees of irrational behavior. Larger models exhibit subtler biases, while smaller ones manifest more pronounced irrational behaviors, posing risks in real-world financial applications.
Despite advancements in simulating human thinking, current generative AI models still have limitations. While there is anticipation for AI agents to realize their full potential, questions arise regarding the potential threats they may pose to humans. As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative to critically evaluate its capabilities and implications in strategic contexts.
