## Question one

When envisioning the convergence of computer science and economics, I aspire to follow in the footsteps of Nobel laureate Claudia Goldin and Turing Award recipients Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, each making profound contributions to their respective fields.
Claudia Goldin's groundbreaking research on gender differences in the labor market illuminates the intricate interplay of social structures, education, and individual career expectations (The Nobel Prize, 2023). Inspired by her work, I recognize the importance of adjusting my own career attitudes and preparing for the challenges influenced by gender dynamics.
Likewise, the pioneering work of Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie in asymmetric public-key cryptography revolutionized cybersecurity (Association for Computing Machinery, 2019). Their invention laid the foundation for secure communication in the digital age, an area of immense relevance and interest to me.
Considering the advancements made by these esteemed scholars, I am acutely aware of the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital labor market. The proliferation of career opportunities in this realm underscores the significance of adopting appropriate career expectations. Notably, while artificial intelligence (AI) was once merely capable of identifying cats on YouTube with limited accuracy (New York Times, 2023), it has now become a dominant force. However, the security implications of generative AI, encompassing images, text, and audio, remain prominent alongside its advancements.
My envisioned contribution lies in addressing the security challenges posed by generative AI, guided by the pioneering work of Hellman and Diffie. By leveraging their principles in asymmetric cryptography, I aim to fortify the security infrastructure of generative AI systems, ensuring their responsible and safe deployment in various domains.
In essence, by synthesizing insights from economics and computer science, I endeavor to advance human civilization by promoting gender equity in the labor market and bolstering the security of emerging technologies, thereby fostering a more inclusive and secure digital future.
