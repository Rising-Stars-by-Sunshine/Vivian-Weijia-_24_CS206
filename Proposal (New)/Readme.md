## The research description

### Summarize the Background/Motivation
- What are the gaps between the existing literature and the pressing social and economic issues in the digital economy of complex system involving both human and AI agent that inspires your research?
  - Gaps in Existing Literature and Economic Issues: Traditional economic models often fail to adapt to the dynamic and rapidly evolving digital economies, which are characterized by information asymmetry. These models typically assume complete rationality and static environments, which are unrealistic in today's digital marketplaces. This research seeks to bridge these gaps by integrating AI into game theory to enhance decision-making and align market transactions with actual product values, addressing the limitations highlighted by Akerlof’s 'Lemon Market' model.
  
### Research Questions
- What are the questions that your research intends to answer?
  - Can AI counterbalance the shortcomings of traditional game theory models, especially in addressing information asymmetry in marketplaces?
  - What role does AI play in the dynamic alignment of market transactions with the standards of quality and value?
  - How can a trust-centric AI scoring system mitigate the 'lemons problem' in the digital economy?
- Why are the questions important?
  - Importance: To determine if AI can enhance market efficiency by minimizing information gaps and improving decision-making processes.
  - Importance: Investigates AI's capability in real-time assessment and adjustment to maintain market integrity and adapt to changing conditions.
  - Importance: To develop and assess an AI-driven system that fosters trust and filters out inferior goods, reducing the prevalence of low-quality products in the market.
- Why are the questions not answered by existing game theory literature?
  - Static vs. Dynamic Modeling: Traditional game theory models tend to be static and do not adequately adapt to the changing conditions and continuous data flows characteristic of digital markets. These models often fail to capture the real-time dynamics and the rapid evolution of strategies that AI-driven systems can manage.
  - Complexity and Information Asymmetry: Existing literature has often struggled with complex scenarios where information asymmetry plays a significant role. Akerlof’s "Lemon Market" model highlighted how information asymmetry leads to market inefficiencies, but traditional approaches do not provide a mechanism to dynamically adjust to the varied information levels that AI technologies can analyze and interpret.
  - Integration of AI in Economic Theory: While there have been significant advancements in AI, its integration into economic game theory to address these gaps is still emerging. The existing game theory literature has not yet fully exploited the capabilities of AI to enhance economic models, particularly in terms of real-time assessment, adjustment, and prediction of market behaviors.
  - Behavioral and Adaptive Economic Modeling: Traditional game theory often overlooks the behavioral aspects of decision-making in economic models. The introduction of AI allows for the simulation of more realistic decision-making processes that account for human cognitive biases and limited rationality, which are not typically considered in more traditional economic models.
### Application Scenario
- In which real-world situation does your newly proposed game and/or solution concept or mechanism apply?
- What is the literature in other discipline such as psychology that could provide a behavioral foundation of your newly proposed game and/or solution concept, or mechanism?
  - Real-World Application: The model is particularly applicable in online car marketplaces, where information asymmetry between sellers and buyers often leads to poor-quality vehicle sales. AI agents can level the playing field by assessing the quality and value of vehicles, promoting transparency and trust.
### Methodology
- What is the key game theoretical or mechanism design framework that you build upon?
- What is the key computational or analytical tools that you apply to answer your requestion question?
- What is the advanced technology or interdisciplinary insights that you integrate into the existing methods that smartly solve your research question?
  - Key Frameworks and Tools: The research builds upon advanced game-theoretical models enhanced by AI, utilizing reinforcement learning algorithms. AI agents learn from historical data to predict market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly, which is tested using the Game Theory Explorer tool.
### Preliminary Results
- Can you provide a concrete illustration example of game theory or mechanism design that your approach significantly improves at least one objective of human welfare compared to existing research without your approach?
  - Illustration of Improved Human Welfare: AI-driven strategies in the game-theoretical model allow consumers to confidently purchase vehicles that meet their needs, improving market trust and consumer welfare. For instance, AI's ability to distinguish between high and low-quality products directly leads to better consumer outcomes.
### Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts of your project
- Can you demonstrate the limitation of your current research that would inspire future research? For example, what are the other important objectives of human welfare that you approach does not consider yet?
- Can you elaborate on how your research can be applied to improve individual, company, and government decisions in strategic scenarios or social choice issues?
  - Contribution and Future Implications: This research advances economic theory by integrating AI to create more dynamic and realistic models of market behavior. It lays the groundwork for more robust economic systems that can dynamically respond to market changes. Practically, it enhances decision-making in online marketplaces and could influence public policy by demonstrating the benefits of AI in economic structures.
