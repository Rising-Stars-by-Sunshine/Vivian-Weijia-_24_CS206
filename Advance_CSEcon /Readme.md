## Question One

In the realm of experimental economics, oTree has served as a valuable tool for conducting strategic interaction studies, yet certain pain points persist, hindering the seamless execution of behavioral game theory research. Through a thorough analysis of my experiences with oTree, supplemented by literature reviews and class discussions, I have identified critical areas for improvement and proposed a software solution that not only addresses these limitations but also enhances strategic interaction studies in experimental economics.

Firstly, a notable pain point in using oTree lies in the management of game details, particularly evident in scenarios such as the trust game. In my experience, discrepancies in instruction details arose when editing the game parameters, leading to confusion among participants (fig.1). Since the oTree tutorial video (2021) states that the oTree consists of HTML, CSS, and Python, to mitigate this issue, the proposed software solution should feature user-friendly interfaces with aligned changes across all relevant instructions by adjusting the CSS part or editing HTML part. By synchronizing changes in game parameters to corresponding instructions, the likelihood of contradictory information decreases, thus enhancing the overall user experience and data integrity.

Secondly, to effectively test users' rationality across different game sequences, the software should facilitate enhanced connections between games. In my experiments, altering the order of games elicited varying participant responses, underscoring the importance of understanding the impact of game sequencing on decision-making behavior. The proposed solution should incorporate visual cues or reminders at the onset of each game, indicating the treatment condition and prompting participants to recall previous interactions. By fostering cognitive continuity between games, researchers can elicit more consistent and insightful responses, thus enriching the validity of experimental outcomes.

Thirdly, to deepen participant engagement and facilitate comprehensive data collection, the software should include post-game explanations and feedback mechanisms. Incorporating brief explanations of game logic at the experiment's conclusion can enhance participants' understanding of the study's objectives and foster reflective thinking. Additionally, providing space for participants to share their feelings or insights can yield qualitative data that complements quantitative analyses, offering valuable insights into decision-making processes and behavioral dynamics.

The proposed software solution aims to outperform oTree in three key aspects: enhancing the user experience through synchronized instructions, fostering cognitive continuity between games, and facilitating comprehensive data collection. These advancements are crucial for advancing experimental economics research by promoting methodological rigor, improving participant engagement, and generating nuanced insights into strategic decision-making behaviors.

In conclusion, by addressing the identified pain points and integrating innovative features, the proposed software solution holds the potential to significantly enhance strategic interaction studies in experimental economics. By leveraging technology to streamline experimental procedures and enhance participant experiences, researchers can advance our understanding of economic behavior and contribute to the development of robust theoretical frameworks and empirical findings in the field (fig.2).
